# virtual-wallet-exchange

It should be a mobile app, where people can sign up and have a virtual wallet that they can fund from their bank account which is in Currency 1. They should then be able to, in the app, get the equivalent USD. They should also be able to create a virtual card like through apple pay so that they can make payments. The sign up process should be easy, and should include creating credentials, uploading an ID and take a photo to verify the person to the ID they signed up, and then also connect their bank account
